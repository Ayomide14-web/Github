PCOS Prediction & Lifestyle Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the impact of lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, smoking, stress, weight, and age) on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Using data visualization and predictive modeling, it provides insights into risk factors and potential lifestyle adjustments to manage PCOS.


📊 Data Processing & Methodology

1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning

The dataset includes age, weight, diet preferences (milk, vegetables, fats), exercise frequency, smoking habits, and PCOS status.

Missing values are handled using median imputation.

Data is categorized into meaningful groups (e.g., age ranges, diet rankings 1-7).


2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

PCOS Prevalence by Age Group 📊

Weight vs. PCOS Status 📈

Exercise & PCOS Correlation 🏋️‍♀️

Dietary Impact on PCOS 🍏


3️⃣ Predictive Modeling

A PCOS Risk Prediction Model is built using decision trees/random forest.

Users can input lifestyle factors, and the model predicts PCOS risk (High/Low) with suggested diet & lifestyle recommendations.


🎗️ Raising Awareness on PCOS

PCOS affects 1 in 10 women of reproductive age.

Lifestyle adjustments (balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management) can help reduce symptoms.

This project aims to help individuals make informed health decisions through data-driven insights.


💡 How to Use This Project
